# Contributing to HCS analysis

### Suggest developement and report bugs

Please use the Github issues to report bugs or ask for new analysis.
Similarly, if you would like to expand the software to new type of raw data,
start there so that I can help you get started and other users may learn about your initiative!


### Fixing documentation

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

### New analyses

In order to build new analysis, I would encourage you to start by using the `analysis/master_noshiny.R` file to upload some data, you can then use the .rdata file created (this does not work with the shiny app.).

You may want to have a look at `archives_notpeerreviewed⁩/testscode⁩/analyseBseq` to see how to access the raw data (that code is trying to analyse sequence of behavior).


### Pull request process

Please check github help center to learn how to create pull requests.

### Code of Conduct

We do not have a code of conduct, but please be nice and welcome any contribution.
